SFWify
======
Browser addon that prevents submissions meeting an user criteria from appearing on the Furaffinity home, browse, or search pages.

Screw the inflation / diaper / feet porn!

Issues
------
-	SFWify may behave slowly to avoid triggering Furaffinity's (possibly anti-DDoS) rate limit system. A fix is being worked on. Right now using prefetch and waiting helps.
-	Some users improperly tag or provide no tags to their submissions. Try blocking that user.
-	buggy
