SFWify
======
Browser addon that prevents submissions meeting an user criteria from appearing on the Furaffinity home, browse, or search pages.

Screw the inflation / diaper / feet porn!

Issues
------
- SFWify may behave slowly to avoid triggering Furaffinity's (possibly anti-DDoS) rate limit system. A fix is being worked on. Right now using prefetch and waiting helps.
- Some users improperly tag or provide no tags to their submissions. Try blocking that user.

Install
-------
Chrome:
SFWify still needs approval by the Chrome Store. Right now you will have to install it manually.
